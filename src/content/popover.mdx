## Description

A popover is a wrapper for content that floats above other elements on the page. It is shown or hidden by interacting (usually clicking, but can also be on focus or hover) with a **trigger element** such as a button. The popover appears above, below, or to one side of this trigger element, often with a small triangle linking the two elements.

![An example of a popover from the Twilio Paste Design System. A button with the label 'Open Popover' is shown with a bubble below containing text and a close icon. A small arrow is pointing from the bubble to the button.](./images/twilio_paste_popover.png 'An example of a popover from the Twilio Paste Design System.')

Note: In some cases, such as in [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/react/popover), the popover can be used as a primitive component for building other components like navigation menus. This article does not cover that use case.

## Example markup

Here is some example markup for a popover trigger and popover in its closed state:

```html
<!-- Popover trigger -->
<button
  type="button"
  aria-expanded="false"
  aria-controls="popover"
  aria-haspopup="dialog"
>
  Expand Popover
</button>
<!-- Popover -->
<div id="popover" role="dialog" hidden>
  <button type="button">Close popover</button>
  <header>This is the popover title</header>
  <p>This is the popover body</p>
</div>
```

In the open state, set the `aria-expanded` attribute on the popover trigger to `false` and remove the `hidden` attribute from the popover.

## Interactivity

Opening the popover can be triggered using the [click event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/click_event) on the button. This event will be triggered on mouse click, touch, and key press (<kbd>Enter ↵</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd>).

The popover should be closed whenever the user does any of the following actions:

- Presses the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key
- Presses a close button in the popover
- Clicks outside of the popover

## Accessibility

Ensure that users can open, navigate, and close the popover using only a keyboard:

- When focused on the trigger button, <kbd>Enter ↵</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd> should toggle display of the popover
- When the popover is expanded, <kbd>Esc</kbd> should close the popover and return focus to the trigger button

Ensure the **popover trigger** has an accessible label and communicates the popover's state to assistive technologies:

- Use the `aria-expanded` attribute on the trigger to indicate visibility of the popover
- If your trigger does not have a visible text label, provide an `aria-label` or [visually hidden](/components/visually-hidden) label
- Use the `aria-haspopup` attribute on the trigger to indicate the type of interactive popup that this element triggers, usually `dialog` or `menu`; this should match the `role` of the popover. You can see [all possible values here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-haspopup).
- Use `aria-controls` with the value set to the `id` of the popover element

Ensure the popover content is hidden from assistive technologies when the popover is closed. Some possible ways of doing this include:

- Adding the `hidden` attribute
- Adding the CSS property `display: none` or `visibility: hidden`
- Adding the `inert` attribute
- Adding the `aria-hidden="true"` attribute (you may also need to set any interactive elements inside the popover as non-focusable using `tabindex="-1"`)

Ensure the popover content has the correct attributes:

- The `id` should match the `aria-controls` attribute of the popover trigger.
- The `role` should match the `aria-haspopup` attribute on the popover trigger.

### A note on the `dialog` role

If you're using the `dialog` role on the popover, you need to decide whether the dialog is _modal_ (only the content within the dialog can be interacted with) or _non-modal_ (users can interact with content outside of the dialog).

For modal dialogs you will need to implement a **focus trap** to ensure that keyboard users can navigate through interactive elements in a logical and predictable order without inadvertently moving focus outside of the intended area.

## Usage guidelines

- Because a popover is hidden by default, it should only contain **non-critical information**. If you have space to show this information outside a popover without cluttering your interface, you should do so. One possible use for a popover is to hide information that's irrelevant once the user is familiar with an interface.

- Keep the content inside your popovers short to prevent it being cut off on smaller screens (or needing an internal scrollbar).

- **The trigger for your popover should trigger your popover and nothing else**. If you add popover functionality to an element which is already interactive (e.g. a link), the two actions will be triggered at the same time on touch devices. This might work for desktop users – those with a mouse or touchpad – but on touch devices, the focus, hover, and active states happen simultaneously.

## Future developments

Since version 114, Chromium (the browser engine for Chrome and Edge amongst others) has included a [Popover API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API) designed to simplify the process of implementing popover components. This introduces new [`popovertarget` and `popover` attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/popover).

```html
<!-- Popover trigger -->
<button popovertarget="popover">Open Popover</button>
<!-- Popover -->
<div popover id="popover">Popover content</div>
```

The popover element is given the `popover` attribute and an `id`. The popover trigger is given the `popovertarget` attribute with its value matching the `id` of the popover element. Clicking on the popover trigger will now toggle the visibility of the popover element without any custom JavaScript.

Popovers created using the popover API are always **non-modal**.

At the time of writing, this is still an experimental technology so should not be used in production. Check the [caniuse page](https://caniuse.com/?search=popover) for current browser support.
