## Description

A tabbed interface consists of two key parts:

- the **tab list** containing the tab elements, along the top or side of…
- the **tab panels** which contain the content.

Each tab panel has an associated tab in the tab list, that when activated, displays the panel. Only one panel of content is shown at any one time.

Tabs are an example of an [interface metaphor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_metaphor), named after the tabs attached to the top of folders used inside filing cabinets. Each tab is given a label based on the documents inside its corresponding folder. Like their real-world namesake tabbed interfaces allow a user to see the outline of a larger set of data at a glance and quickly navigate to the desired section.

## Markup

Here is example markup based on the [W3C recommended accessible markup](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#tabpanel) for tabs. It describes a set of two tabs, with the first one selected:

```html
<!-- Tabs -->
<div role="tablist" aria-orientation="horizontal">
  <button
    role="tab"
    aria-selected="true"
    id="tab-1"
    aria-controls="tab-panel-1"
  >
    Tab 1
  </button>
  <button
    role="tab"
    aria-selected="false"
    id="tab-2"
    aria-controls="tab-panel-2"
  >
    Tab 2
  </button>
</div>
<!-- Tab panels -->
<div id="tab-panel-1" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="tab-1">
  <h2>Tab panel 1 content</h2>
</div>
<div
  id="tab-panel-2"
  role="tabpanel"
  aria-labelledby="tab-2"
  style="display: none;"
>
  <h2>Tab panel 2 content</h2>
</div>
```

To communicate the semantic meaning and current state of each element to assistive technology, it makes extensive use of aria attributes:

- Use `role="tab"` on each **tab** element and `role="tablist"` on the tab list.
- Give each **tab panel** `role="tabpanel"`.
- If the tabs are _vertically_ oriented (stacked one on top of the other), give the **tab list** the attribute `aria-orientation="vertical"` (If your tabs are oriented _horizontally_, you can leave this attribute out as horizontal is the default).
- If the **tab list** has a visible label, link it to the label with `aria-labelledby="{labelId}"`. Alternatively, the tab list should be labelled using the `aria-label` attribute.
- Each **tab** should have the attribute `aria-controls="{tabPanelId}"` linking it to the associated tab panel.
- The _active_ **tab** should have `aria-selected` set to true and all other tabs should have it set to false.
- Each **tab panel** should have `aria-labelledby="{tabId}"` to link it with its associated tab element.

## Styling

When styling your tabs, you can make use of the `aria-selected` attribute to style the active tab differently. e.g.

```css
.tab[aria-selected='true'] {
  background-color: var(--active-tab-bg-color);
  color: var(--active-tab-text-color);
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

Ensure each tab also has a visible `:focus` state.

To show/hide the tab panels you will need to toggle the CSS display property between `display: none;` and a visible value such as `display: block;`.

## Interactivity

In addition to aria attributes on your HTML elements, to make a tabbed interface keyboard-accessible, you’ll also need to add some custom keybindings[^1]:

<!-- MDX can't parse markdown if an li starts with a kbd element ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ -->

- &#8203;<kbd>Tab</kbd>: When tabbing into the tab list, place focus on the active tab element. When focus is on a tab _inside_ the tab list, pressing tab should move focus to the next focusable element in the page _outside_ the tab list.
- &#8203;<kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> should activate the currently focused tab if it wasn't activated automatically on focus.
- &#8203;<kbd>←</kbd> and <kbd>→</kbd> to cycle between tabs when `aria-orientation="vertical"`.
- &#8203;<kbd>↑</kbd> and <kbd>↓</kbd> to cycle between tabs when `aria-orientation="horizontal"`.

**Caveat:** although this is a widely used method for making tabbed interfaces keyboard accessible, some users may not be familiar it; a component that is simpler to interact with ([such as an accordion](/components/accordion)) may be more suited to your specific use case.

## Usage guidelines

- The main benefit of tabs is that they allow a large amount of information to be displayed in a limited space.

- Be conscious that when you’re using tabs, you’re hiding content. This not only makes it less discoverable for sighted users, but also for users of assistive technology like screen readers.

- If you're laying out your tabs horizontally, think about how they will appear at narrower screen widths — will they need to stack vertically or will you be better off swapping out the tabs for a different component (e.g. [an accordion](/components/accordion))?
